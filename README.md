# Let Me Out

A game jam project for Brackeys gam jam starting on the 12.02.2023. 
The theme is: An end is a new beginning.

## About

It's a platformer containing levels which introduce the player to new mechanics.
The premise is that without knowing about the mechanics you shouldn't be able to
complete the levels. Throughout the level there are points you should collect,
to win the game. The theme is centered in electronics, the player is a capacitor,
the points are charges, and touching the exposed circuit boards makes the player
loose some charge. Depleting the charge completely results in "death".
